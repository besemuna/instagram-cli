# Select
This command currently selects likers of a media for later following or unfollowing.
```bat
php app.php select <type>
```
The supported types are just `likers`, support for `followers` and `following` would be added
soon.

Enter your username and password and wait for the magic to happen.

To pass options to the command reference the [options documentation](../options.md)
